# GPS and IMU C/C++ Driver for Rover

This project is focused on converting existing GPS and IMU Python code into C++. It provides a comprehensive C/C++ driver for GPS and IMU modules, allowing you to interface with these sensors in your rover project.

## Features

- Conversion of Python code to C++ for GPS and IMU functionality.
- Integration of Git pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with this project:

1. **Fork this Repository**: Start by [forking this template repository](https://github.com/your-username/rover-cpp-driver) to your own GitHub account. This will allow you to work on your own copy of the project.

2. **Install Git Hooks**: Use the provided `setup.py` script to install Git pre-commit hooks. These hooks ensure that your code adheres to quality standards before committing changes.

3. **Programming**: Begin programming your rover using the GPS and IMU modules provided in this repository. You can customize and extend the code to suit your project's specific needs.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main modules:

- **GPS Module**: Contains code for interfacing with the GPS sensor.

- **IMU Module**: Includes code for working with the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor.

- **UBX_Lib**: A library for GPS communication, implementing the UBX protocol for GPS data exchange.

Feel free to explore and modify these modules to meet your requirements.
